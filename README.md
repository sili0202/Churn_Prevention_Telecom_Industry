# Machine_Learning_Proposal_Churn_Prevention_Telecom_Industry
How should a telecommunication company utilise the data to predict if a customer churns or not?

One of the telecom company's markets has a challenge with a high level of churn in the first 3 months for customers that initially purchase bundles.

Create a story to advise the Country Marketing Director on:

- 2 potential options for analytical solutions that could help solve this challenge, one low effort and one high effort â€“ which would you recommend as the best solution?

- What type of data would you need or want in order to effectively build this? How long would it take to build and deploy an effective solution? (assume all necessary tools and technology are in place)

- How you would test the solution to make sure it is effective, and how would you monitor and maintain it ongoing?
